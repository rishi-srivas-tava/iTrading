                    In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the
                    direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume.As a type of
                    active management, it stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of
                    technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market
                    prices are essentially unpredictable,and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit
                    has produced mixed results </p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Option chain is a list or table of all available option contracts.
                    It includes stocks and index with put option and call option, for a given security. The table
                    includes information on Open Interest, volume, Implied Volatility(IV), strike price, premium etc. of
                    a option contract for a given exipration date. Remember, just as there is an option chain for the
                    Nifty, banknifty & other, you have option chains for all the key indices traded in F&O and also for
                    individual stocks where options trading is permitted. However option chain is relevant only when the
                    contract is sufficiently liquid. </p>

                    a business's financial statements (usually to analyze the business's assets, liabilities, and
                    earnings); health; and competitors and markets. It also considers the overall state of the economy
                    and factors including interest rates, production, earnings, employment, GDP, housing, manufacturing
                    and management. There are two basic approaches that can be used: bottom up analysis and top down
                    analysis.These terms are used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis,
                    such as quantitative and technical. </p>
